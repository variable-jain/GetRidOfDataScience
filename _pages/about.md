# Hi, This is Varun

I am a budding data scientist, currently studying at **Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur** and Incoming business associate at PwC SDC India.

I have been studying data science for about an year now. Being a major in mathematics, I got a head start in the field and is now working my way up.

This blog is an attempt to get rid of certain problems between you and an awesome data scientist. I plan to include articles on machine learning, deep learning, and miscellaneous but related stuff. Hope you enjoy it!!

Please appreciate me by following me on my github : [variable-jain](https://github.com/variable-jain)
